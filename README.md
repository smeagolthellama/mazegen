# mazegen

Needs a BGI implementation.

For windows users:
-
I recommend [winbgi](http://winbgim.codecutter.org/), as that is what I designed the portability parts for. No Idea if it works for anything else.
For Linux users:
-
I recommend [sdlbgi](http://libxbgi.sourceforge.net), as that is what I designed it to work with. Possibly works with libxbgi as well, but probably not.
